    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pav Bhaji is a native Maharashtrian dish made with an assortment of mashed vegetables, pan-fried on a large tawa and served with Pav toasted in butter. It is immensely popular all across the country because of its spicy and tangy zest.</p>
    <p>The generous dose of butter that is often used with freshly-cut onions and lemon juice tops the dish. Pav Bhaji is also a great way to feed fussy kids their share of veggies with a smile! You can also serve Pav Bhaji in a bruschetta/canap√© style for your next party.</p>
